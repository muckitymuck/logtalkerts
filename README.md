# LogTalker 

## Description
This project is a personal experiment to see if RAG LLM apps can be developed to ingest IT documentation and logging files and output analysis and recommendations.  

Files are vectorized and then searched by LLM for relevant information regarding the network status and incidents.

Project is built on NextJS, OpenAI, MongoDB, React, and Docker.

## Future Improvements

Plans are in place to allow the app to ingest files from upload or directly from IT devices.
